## 📖 About

**HtopRust** is a modern system monitor for Windows, inspired by the popular `htop` tool on Linux. Built entirely in Rust, it brings the power and elegance of terminal-based monitoring to Windows with native performance and zero dependencies.

### Why HtopRust?

Windows users have long envied the simplicity and power of `htop` on Linux. While Task Manager and Resource Monitor are useful, they lack the efficiency and keyboard-driven workflow that makes `htop` so beloved. HtopRust bridges this gap by providing:

- **Native Performance**: Written in Rust with direct Windows API calls
- **Zero Dependencies**: Single portable executable, no runtime required
- **Rich Features**: Beyond basic monitoring - includes Wi-Fi details, 802.1x authentication info, and Windows Event Log integration
- **Modern UI**: Color-coded, mouse-enabled terminal interface with real-time updates
- **Smart Adaptation**: Auto-detects language, terminal capabilities, and privilege level

### Author

Created by **Olivier Noblanc** in 2026 as a personal project to bring professional-grade system monitoring to Windows in a lightweight, portable package.
